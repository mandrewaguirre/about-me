          <h2>Bio:</h2>
            <p>
              I grew up in Seattle, WA. So, I am one of the few natives you will ever meet in Seattle. Most of my work related skills<br> have been in the hospitality industry,
              which has give me so many skills in relating to many different people, thinking on my feet, and anticipating needs.
